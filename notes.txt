Lets create the first graph, that shows how accuracy varies for single subject single session
kmeans classification as k varies with W=600 and N=1, and lets just use the minaccuracy
so we see what the accuracy is for each of the four activities and take the minimum...

What measures of accuracy
1) Draw the overview plots ... gives visual representation of accuracy
2) Calculate the prediction accuracy per activity and get 4 probabilities
    take min and take mean, median for those probabilities...


What to classify?
1) MSRO do all 4 classifications ...
2) pairwise -- just try to classify MvS or MvR or SvO or .. MRvSO
3) others are classify by subject id (try to recognize different subjects)
4) try to classify by session (probably not for good ...)
We can do
MvSvRvO
MvS


Within Subject Classification
How good is kmeans at representing an activity map, i.e. predicting activity classifications?
and how does the accuracy vary based on k, W, N
3 graphs for MvSvRvO
   e.g. try baseline of k=120 W=600 N=5, then
       let k vary from say 4,12,48,120,600,1200 and
       for each k we get 36 accuracies (one for each session)
       can use a box and whisker plot to show the effect of k on accuracy ...
       Same for W, say with W=1,10,100,300,600,1200,3000
       Same for N=1,2,4,8,16...
3 graphs for MvS

How regular are the brainwaves for a single subject across multiple sessions.
Use 4-fold crossover validation. Train on 3, predict on 4th, average results...
using best k,W,N from previous...
Show all 36 prediction graphs (based on training on the other three...)
1 plot for each MVSR and MS

Between Subject Classification
How good is kmeans at representing an activity map for all 9 subjects....
Use one classifier for all 9 subjects and see how the accuracy varies based on
3 graphs for MvSvRvO  (k varies, W varies, N varies)
3 for MvS

How regular are the brainwave for different subjects across all sessions.
Use 9-fold crossover validation. Train on 8 subjects (all sessions), test on 9th subject, average.
Show the prediction graphs....
2 plots ...





The next thing I need to do is to describe in detail the kinds of analysis
we need to do. The key ideas are:
1) discuss measures of accuracy for a k-means classifier
2) discuss the parameters used to tune k-means
    k
    N
    W
    c
3) show how accuracy varies based on different choices of the k-means parameters

Another issue to discuss is what we choose to classify, e.g.

Math vs Shut
 We can get 98% mean window accuracy for k=120 W=600 N=3

Math vs Read vs Shut vs Open
We can get 82% min win accuracy for k=120 W=600 (and 97% mean win accuracy)
